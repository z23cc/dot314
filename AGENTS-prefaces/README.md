# AGENTS Prefaces

Templates for the start of `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` files. These steer agents to use RepoPrompt tools preferentially and effectively.

## Files

- `rp-cli-preface.md` — RepoPrompt CLI integration (`rp_exec`, `rp_bind`)
- `rp-mcp-preface.md` — RepoPrompt MCP integration (`rp` tool)
- `rp-mcp-preface-exPi.md` — MCP variant for non-Pi harnesses (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)

## Notes

The Pi-targeted prefaces include guidance to use the `questionnaire` extension for user questions—available in both dot314 and pi-mono under `/extensions`.

The exPi variant is intended for other agent harnesses and omits Pi-specific features.
